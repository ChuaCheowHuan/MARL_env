This is **WIP**.

# What's in this repository?
A custom MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning) environment where multiple
agents trade against one another in a CDA (continuous double auction).

The environment doesn't use any external data. Data is generated by self play
of the agents themselves through their interaction with the limit order book.

At each time step, the environment emits the top k rows of the aggregated
order book as observations to the agents.

# Example:
An example of using RLlib to pit 1 PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent
against 3 random agents using this CDA environment is available in:
```
CDA_env_disc_RLlib.py
```

To run:
```
cd gym-continuousDoubleAuction/gym_continuousDoubleAuction
```
```
python CDA_env_disc_RLlib.py
```

The figure below from Tensorboard shows the agents' performance:

PPO agent is using policy 0 while policies 1 to 3 are used by the random agents.

# Dependencies:
1) Tensorflow
2) OpenAI's Gym
3) Ray [RLlib] 0.7.3

Please see `requirements.txt`.

# Installation:
The environment is installable via pip.
```
cd gym-continuousDoubleAuction
```
```
pip install -e .
```

# TODO:
1) custom RLlib workflow to include custom RND + PPO policies.
2) parametric or hybrid action space
3) more robust tests
3) better documentation
